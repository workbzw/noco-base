# Important Features

## 1. Separate "data structure" and "user interface"

Most form-, table-, or process-driven codeless products create data structures directly in the user interface, such as Airtable, where adding a new column to a table is adding a new field. This has the advantage of simplicity of use, but the disadvantage of limited functionality and flexibility to meet the needs of more complex scenarios.

NocoBase adopts the design idea of separating the data structure from the user interface, allowing you to create any number of blocks (data views) for the data collections, with different type, styles, content, and actions in each block. This takes into account the simplicity of codeless operation, but also the flexibility of native development.

## 2. Separate "system configuration" and "system usage"

NocoBase is used to develop relatively complex business systems. In these scenarios, we want the system developers and the system users to be different roles. The user sees a mature, well-designed system, like a product developed natively, rather than a rigid, drag-and-drop free system that can be modified at any time; while the developer can quickly develop the system using a WYSIWYG approach.

## 3. Everything isÂ plugins

NocoBase adopts plugin architecture, all new features can be implemented by developing and installing plugins. In the future, we will build a plug-in marketplace where extending functionality is as easy as installing an APP on your phone.
