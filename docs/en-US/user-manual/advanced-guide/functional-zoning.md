# Functional zoning

NocoBase has a built-in layout template by default, and the interface of this layout template is divided into three main areas.

1. Configuration entry area. Users with permissions can see the UI Editor, Collections & Fields, Roles and Permissions, block templates, Workflows, and other extended configuration options here.
2. Menu area. At the top is the first level menu, and on the left side are the menus for the second level and lower tiers. Each menu item can be configured as a menu group, page, or link.
3. Block container. This is the block container for the page, in which various blocks can be placed.
