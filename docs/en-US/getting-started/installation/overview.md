# Overview

## Installation Methods

NocoBase supports three installation methods.

- [Docker (recommended)](./docker-compose.md)
- [create-nocobase-app](./create-nocobase-app.md)
- [Git source code](./git-clone.md)

## How to choose

**Docker (recommended)**:

Suitable for no-code scenarios, no code to write. When upgrading, just download the latest image and reboot.

**create-nocobase-app**:

The business code of the project is completely independent and supports low-code development.

**Git source code**:

If you want to experience the latest unreleased version, or want to participate in the contribution, you need to make changes and debug on the source code, it is recommended to choose this installation method, which requires a high level of development skills, and if the code has been updated, you can git pull the latest code.
